We based our project on a Divorce dataset from kaggle. We wanted to use this data to make predictions about the probability of a divorce, given a set of satisfaction ratings of answers to questions about participants’ marriage.
Our process was divided into steps listed below:
1. Cleaning the data (Nora, Dhriti and Michaël): We first sat down to figure out how to use our dataset in order to accurately 
build our ML models. We figured out that with the data turned into numerical values in our dataset we could reach reliable and 
valid predictions. Thus, we decided to drop the columns corresponding to any categorical values as they are not of interest to us 
in this project.

2. Build the model with the data 
a. Model 1: Michaël
  i. Linear Regression
  ii. Confusion matrix

b. Model 2: Celia and Zulima
  i. Decision trees
  ii. Cross Validation

c. Model 3: Nora
  i. Logistic Regression with one feature
  ii. Confusion Matrix

3. Deciding targets to consider for predictions - All

4. Predicting outcome and cleaning code. Double-checking code. - Nora and Michaël

5. Writing report - Zulima and Dhriti

Our conclusions:
1. Divorce is highly predictable in this dataset. This is due to the fact that the questions were
extensive and detailed and resulted in a very high accuracy score

2. Some machine learning methods are better than other ones as can be seen from the accuracy
scores; for example, we got close to perfect accuracy scores for the logistic regression and decision trees, 
but less so for the linear regression model.
