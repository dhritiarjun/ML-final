We based our project on a Divorce dataset from kaggle. We wanted to use this data to make predictions about the probability of a divorce, 
given a set of satisfaction ratings of answers to questions about participants’ marriage. We used 3 different methods:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Logistic Regression
